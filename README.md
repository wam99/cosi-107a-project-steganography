# COSI 107a Course Project: Steganography
Team: William Messenger

For my COSI107a Computer Security course project, I will be exploring the topic of stegnography, or the process of embedding secret data within another file, such as an image, audio, or text. I plan to explore how the process works, what types of secret and visible files can be used, how to write a steganography program, how to apply it to images, audio, and text that I create, and what the possible use cases are for steganography.
